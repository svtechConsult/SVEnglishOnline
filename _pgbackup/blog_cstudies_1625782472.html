    a place where we can learn from each other to enhance knowledge and facility success&nbsp;</p><a href="blog-single.html" target="_pg_blank" class="fs-4 link-secondary mb-3 mt-3">Aziz, A Middle Eastern Managing Director</a><p class="fs-5 fw-normal mb-3"></p><p class="fs-5 fw-normal mb-3">Aziz came to us with a desire to become fluent in English, and engaged with us for an intensive six month course of study to accomplish this goal.</p><p class="fs-5 fw-normal mb-3">Although he had a high level of English competency, he wasn&apos;t confident in his English communications skills including listening, writing, and speaking. </p><p class="fs-5 fw-normal mb-3">In the initial interview, he was hesitant, had a hard time finding the words, and spoke in a low monotone voice with many uncomfortable pauses.
</p><p class="fs-5 fw-normal mb-3">We performed the Gap Analysis where he tested at a C1 level but missed several lower level questions. We quickly fixed the basic grammar issues with a test review and a few homework assignments.
</p><p class="fs-5 fw-normal mb-3">Along with his desire to be more fluent, was an objective to create a global alliance under the leadership of his company. This is a complex task for any executive, let alone where English is a second language.

We decided focus on becoming fluent in the activities required to achieve the Global Alliance objective. We started several reading and speaking exercises to train him to speak with confidence. Shadowing powerful speakers like President Obama, learning intonation, pace, timber, and how to use pauses for effect, while gathering thoughts for the next few words. This worked very well.
</p><p class="fs-5 fw-normal mb-3">Next, we focused on what was required to secure and conduct meetings with English speaking executives. We developed Vision &amp; Mission statements which we incorporated into a Canva Pitch Deck. Then we practiced in a role play until he was completely comfortable. The Pitch Desk is something that company executives have to learn inside and out; to be prepared to speak to any of the topics at a moments notice. Aziz accomplished this very well.
</p><p class="fs-5 fw-normal mb-3">Then we moved on to attention getting email templates. We developed this content in a mentoring / learning fashion, not &lsquo;let me do it for you&rsquo;. He then worked with others in his company to make these documents into corporate standards. Aziz recently sent the email below to us after his sixth week.</p><img src="assets/img/blog/testimonial_aziz.svg"><p class="fs-6 fw-normal">&quot;As you know, my company has had interest in expanding internationally through strategic partnerships in the media business. With the work that you and I have been doing together on the email template, pitch deck, and speaking exercises, I decided to send emails to two of our target prospects as a test of the email template. I immediately received a response from one of the companies and had a meeting with their senior executive yesterday.
</p><p class="fs-6 fw-normal">The meeting could not have gone better. I researched the contact on LinkedIn and other ways that you had shown me, and found some great common interests, which I used to warm up at the start of the meeting. The meeting went smoothly from there where we talked about visions and strategies. I was so prepared from rehearsing the pitch deck that everything came smoothly. I really felt like a peer to this native English Executive, confident and in control. My partner usually interrupts me, but this time, his only words were &ldquo;Aziz said everything, I have nothing more to add&rdquo;. The outcome would have been totally different if the meeting had taken place before I started working with you. 

I really appreciate the time, effort, and patience you have shown me </p> </h2>
